# Rule-Based Systems and First-Order Logic Repository

## Description
This repository contains Python code and instructions for a series of activities aimed at exploring expert systems, rule-based reasoning, and first-order logic. The activities are designed to provide practical experience in implementing and reasoning with rule-based systems, as well as solving logical puzzles using first-order logic.

## Activities
1. **Crossing Street Rule-Based System**: Implements a simple rule-based system for pedestrian street crossing based on traffic light signals.
2. **Automotive Diagnostics Rule-Based System**: Constructs a rule-based system to diagnose automobile problems based on given conditions.
3. **Santa Puzzle 1**: Solves a puzzle using first-order logic in a Christmas universe involving relationships between Santa, reindeer, and children.
4. **Santa Puzzle 2**: Tackles another puzzle using first-order logic, this time involving Santa, presents, foggy weather, and reindeer.
